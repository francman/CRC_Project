# __CRC PROJECT__

This program computes and checks CRC of "messages". The program computes crc of HELLO and asks the user for input. If the user's messages matches its message, the program exits else the user is asked to repeat the message.

The program also prints out ASCII binary representations of the message as well as the calculated CRC.

The calculated CRC is also printed in HEX if needed for sanity check.

## Requirements

- C Compiler - GCC recommended (GNU C Compiler)

## How To Run
- Clone or Download this directory
- Open a terminal application and navigate to the Engine's folder
